    <p>Oh, chicken alfredo: 
        It's the classic pseudo-Italian pasta 
        we just can't seem to get enough of. 
        Of course there are tons of jarred 
        pasta sauces you can buy, but making 
        alfredo sauce from scratch is actually so easy. </p> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden and cooked through, 8 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes, then slice. </li>
            <li>Add milk, broth, and garlic to skillet. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Add fettuccine, stirring frequently for about 3 minutes. Let cook until al dente, 8 minutes more. </li>
            <li>Stir in heavy cream and Parmesan until combined. Simmer until sauce thickens. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in sliced chicken. Garnish with parsley. </li>
        </ol>
